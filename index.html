        The first thing to remember, even this small project name ORM. It's not even deserve name  ORM. 
        I'm give name ORM caused i don't know how to name except ORM. This project just make a stupid and simple
        Object maker from an sql (JDBC) query result. I'm make this as i look some people strugle to make good query result to
        Object converter. It's not everybody cases. But, i had look at people that assume it's mess/bad code, since i hard
        to debug it. I make this project very simple. So if someone interesting to patch/update feature. Let me know.

            <p>Take a look of this simple UML class diagram and ERD Schema. So, let me explain this very simple (stupid maybe)
                idea to convert an Query Result (JDBC) to a Class. 
            </p>
            <p>
            The question are, how to get All Object of User and All Object of Quiz. 
            Let's analyze this mysql query for retrieve that
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Get All User object:</strong><br />
                <pre>
    SELECT user.id AS user_id,
        user.email AS user_email,
        user.firstName AS user_firstName,
        user.isActive AS user_isActive,
        user.lastName AS user_lastName,
        user.username AS user_username,
        user.userType AS user_userType 
    FROM user
                </pre>
                You can see all fields are give alias with following rules: (table_name)_(field_name) 
                <div>
                    This rules, must be obey when if you use this library. The reason i use alias with this rules. Are to 
                    guarantee the field name are unique, since using sql join will make field names duplicate. 
                    It's important so the library can map the field correctly.
                </div>
                <strong>Get All Quiz object:</strong><br />
                <pre>
    SELECT quiz.id AS quiz_id,
        quiz.name AS quiz_name,
        quiz_category.id AS quiz_category_id,
        quiz_category.name AS quiz_category_name 
    FROM quiz 
    LEFT JOIN quiz_category ON quiz.categoryId = quiz_category.id
                </pre>
                <div>
                Ok now, Quiz object are had one to one relation with Quiz Category. So the mysql query must load all
                fields of both entity. And using left join so it will linked. Now, you look why i must give rules of alias name.
                The id and name field are duplicate. So i must give rules so it will unique.
                </div>
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
        So, the idea. Since the Query field are unique. I make a list of mapping class. 
            <pre>
                public FieldMapping(String propertyName,String fieldName,DataType dataType)...
            </pre>
            <pre>
                e.g: new FieldMapping("id", "id", DataType.INTEGER)
            </pre>
            <div><strong>Property name</strong>, are the class property name</div>
            <div><strong>Field name</strong>, are the field name in table</div>
            <div><strong>Data Type</strong>, are enumerated type of property</div>
        </p>
        <p>
        With this field mapping information. Every query can be map to class more easy. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Let's get started
